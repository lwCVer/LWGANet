  </summary>

Light-weight neural networks for remote sensing (RS) visual analysis must overcome two inherent redundancies: spatial redundancy from vast, homogeneous backgrounds, and channel redundancy, where extreme scale variations render a single feature space inefficient. Existing models, often designed for natural images, fail to address this dual challenge in RS scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose LWGANet, a light-weight backbone engineered for RS-specific properties. LWGANet introduces two core innovations: a Top-K Global Feature Interaction (TGFI) module that mitigates spatial redundancy by focusing computation on salient regions, and a Light-Weight Grouped Attention (LWGA) module that resolves channel redundancy by partitioning channels into specialized, scale-specific pathways. By synergistically resolving these core inefficiencies, LWGANet achieves a superior trade-off between feature representation quality and computational cost. Extensive experiments on twelve diverse datasets across four major RS tasks—scene classification, oriented object detection, semantic segmentation, and change detection—demonstrate that LWGANet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art light-weight backbones in both accuracy and efficiency. Our work establishes a new, robust baseline for efficient visual analysis in RS images.
